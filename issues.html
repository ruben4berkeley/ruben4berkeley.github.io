                            <p>Our housing affordability crisis is simultaneously driving our homelessness crisis. The two problems have one overarching solution: an all-of-the-above approach to building more housing, of all types, and at all income levels, especially affordable housing for very low income individuals. Our homeless residents also need additional supportive services, while tenants need stability and protection from unfair treatment, and opportunities to enter the housing market and become homeowners.</p>
